			My "welcome to college" moment was when I took my first
			calculus midterm in freshman year. Not finishing the
			exam was a harsh blow to my self esteem. I took that
			lesson to heart. I did every homework assignment with
			the goal of complete comfort with each problem type,
			and that paid off (not just for the second midterm). I
			was worried that I would sacrifice my greater
			understanding if I focused too much on solving the
			problems, but I soon learned that if the problems
			require understanding and I solve them myself, then my
			knowledge improved considerably (perhaps I was also
			motivated by having a reason to understand).

			I took introductory chemistry and introductory physics
			as a freshman. I still wasn't sure what exactly I
			wanted to do. I didn't completely have my heart set on
			computer science, though I did enjoy it. Mostly, I
			didn't like the restriction I felt at the major system,
			that I was here to be good at computers and that was
			it. I have a much wider variety of interests, and I
			hoped college would help me solve problems across all
			of those interests. That was the main reason I was
			putting on my safety goggles and learning about
			enthalpy. In the short term, I hoped to do some work in
			computational biology.
