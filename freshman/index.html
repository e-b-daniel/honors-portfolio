		My "welcome to college" moment was when I took my first
		calculus midterm in freshman year. Not finishing the
		exam was a harsh blow to my self esteem. I took that
		lesson to heart. I did every homework assignment with
		the goal of complete comfort with each problem type,
		and that paid off (not just for the second midterm). I
		was worried that I would sacrifice my greater
		understanding if I focused too much on solving the
		problems, but I soon learned that if the problems
		require understanding and I solve them myself, then my
		knowledge improved considerably (perhaps I was also
		motivated by having a reason to understand).

		I took introductory chemistry and introductory physics
		as a freshman. I still wasn't sure what exactly I
		wanted to do. I didn't completely have my heart set on
		computer science, though I did enjoy it. Mostly, I
		didn't like the restriction I felt at the major system,
		that I was here to be good at computers and that was
		it. I have a much wider variety of interests, and I
		hoped college would help me solve problems across all
		of those interests. That was the main reason I was
		putting on my safety goggles and learning about
		enthalpy. In the short term, I hoped to do some work in
		computational biology.
