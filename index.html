    <h3>Learning Statement</h3>
    <p>I started college with a lot of goals. Coming from a year of online schooling, I wanted to get back in the saddle as fast as possible. I had gotten it into my head that I needed to complete all my learning in my formal education. I didn't necessarily need to be done in undergrad, but if I wanted to learn more, then I had better have done enough to go to grad school, because after that, I was set on a track based on what I knew.</p> 
    <p>So I had a lot to get done. I needed to understand how computers work from every level, from the physics of the electrons to the mathematical abstractions of esoteric algorithms. But I wasn't just going to stop there. I wasn't just interested in computers for the sake of them, even though they can be some fun little toys. I needed the knowledge to best apply computational tools to problems in biochemistry. So, add on learning chemistry and biology and I had a good five subjects I wanted to dance with.</p>
    <p>Taking a look at my freshman year, it is clear I stuck to the plan. I took a such a variety of courses it rivaled the offerings in the dining hall. However, I felt like I was only scratching the surface of these fields and not getting anywhere. The next year I took a leap and was lucky enough to be brought under the wing of a PhD student doing computational biophysics, and I naively thought that everything was just going to go perfectly according to plan.</p>
    <p>Then came the quarter from hell, a turning point on my perspective of the college experience. I had finally stretched myself too thin, while trying to do many things, I was unable to do anything. I studied abroad that summer and that gave me some good perspective. In a completely different environment, my peers helped keep me present and focused on only my goals for the study abroad program, getting the most out of the experience there.</p>
    <p>I took that focus into the next year, taking only a few classes tailored to even fewer interests. I mostly emphasized my research. My focus was rewarded with a lot of knowledge and getting on a paper. So, I had learned one key lesson: that I can't do everything at once, I need to focus on a few goals. I was getting somewhere. Yet, I was worried. I could see the undergrad finish line and I wasn't set on the perfect track. Focusing on only a few goals is all well and good, but I felt that I had to accomplish all my learning by the end of the next year, and it wasn't looking easy.</p>
    <p>The summer of my junior year, I got a taste of the corporate world with a software engineering internship. I had two discoveries: I really enjoyed it and I learned a ton. My first thought was that if I ended up on that track then that wouldn't be so bad, but more importantly, I realized I wasn't stuck. I could and would learn a lot outside of formal education and use that to do all sorts of things.</p>
    <p>For the rest of college and beyond, I plan to continue to get closer to achieving many (interdisciplinary) goals, without imposing arbitrary deadlines or trying to achieve to all of them at once.</p>
